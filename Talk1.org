* What is a relational database?
** What is a table?
*** A table is just a spreadsheet
   |     ID | FirstName | LastName |    PhoneNumber |
   |      1 | John      | Doe      | 1(123)567-8910 |
   |      2 | Jane      | Dough    | 2(345)678-9101 |
   |      3 | James     | Martin   | 3(456)789-1011 |
   |      4 | Mary      | Creative | 4(567)891-0111 |
   |--------+-----------+----------+----------------|
   | Number | String    | String   |         String |
*** What is a type?
    - A specifier for "what can go here"
    - Integer, string, date
*** What is a constraint?
**** Don't worry too much about this.
**** It's a way to say "this must be that"
*** What is a key?
**** Primary Key
     - What uniquely identifies this table?
     - In most cases, this is the ID column
**** Foreign Key
     - What is this data related to?
     - This is how we link tables together
**** Composite Keys
     - You can also have a single key made up of multiple columns.
     - Don't worry about that right now.
** What is a query language?
*** CRUD
    I'm going to go over this, but you'll only really ever use the middle two.
**** Create
***** Schema ([[https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_create_table.asp][source]])
      #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      CREATE TABLE Persons (
           PersonID int,
           LastName varchar(255),
           FirstName varchar(255),
           Address varchar(255),
           City varchar(255) 
       );      
       #+END_EXAMPLE
***** Data
      #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      INSERT INTO Persons(LastName, FirstName) VALUES('Jim', 'Jimson');      
       #+END_EXAMPLE
**** Read
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     SELECT 
      Column1,
      Column2
     FROM
      Table
     WHERE
      Condition
      AND Condition2
      OR Condition3
     #+END_EXAMPLE
**** Update ([[https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_update.asp][source]])
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      UPDATE table_name
      SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
      WHERE condition;     
     #+END_EXAMPLE
**** Delete
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      DELETE FROM table_name
      WHERE condition;     
     #+END_EXAMPLE
*** What is a function?
**** Function syntax
***** MethodName([parameters...])
**** What are some useful functions?
     - COUNT
       #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       select 
         count(ID)
       from
         Users
       where
         Name like '%fred%'
       #+END_EXAMPLE
     - MIN/MAX
       #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       select 
         min(Balance) as MinBalance,
         max(Balance) as MaxBalance
       from
         Loans
       #+END_EXAMPLE
     - Average
     - WITH (more on this in a sec)
* Locking... (a special aside)
  [[https://www.sqlshack.com/locking-sql-server/][Source]]
***** PUT "WITH(NOLOCK)" AFTER THE TABLES ON PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING WHEN ON PRODUCTION
***** TLDR: Exclusive locks
      - Granted when an application needs exclusive rights to a specific "table"
      - Prevents anyone else from reading or writing to that table
      - Bad citizenship!  
***** TLDR: Shared locks
      - Granted when someone needs to write to a "table" but doesn't need to
        prevent anyone else from reading.
      - Some variant of this is what most requests will use.
      - Good citizen!  
* How do I do basic reporting?
